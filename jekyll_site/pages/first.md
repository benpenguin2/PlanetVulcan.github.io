#What is FIRST?
FIRST (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. Based in Manchester, New Hampshire, the 501(c)(3) not-for-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.

#FIRST Vision 
>To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.

\- Dean Kamen, Founder

#FIRST Mission
>Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.

#What is FTC?
The team will be competing in is the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). FIRST has designed this competition for students in grades 7-12 as a means for providing not only a foundation and interest in robotics and STEM, but also a method for establishing a community within a team, consisting of those interested in science, as well as business, volunteer work, arts and visual design, and videography. It is with this team and its respective coaches and mentors that will work to design, build, and program their robots in an alliance format against other teams. These robots will have to be built on sound engineering principles and rebuilt as students learn from experience. Awards are given for the competition as well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments.

#What is required from teams?
Every September FIRST releases the details of the competition for the year. The competition consists of an engineering challenge that needs to be solved with a robot. Teams pour over the challenge details and begin to form a strategy to complete the challenge. Throughout the fall, winter and spring teams think, design, build and re-build their robots.

Local competitions are held in the winter and spring with the winner of each receiving an invitation to compete at the FIRST World Championship. Multiple competitions are usually entered and the robots are re-designed between competitions to learn from mistakes and refine strategy and use of technology. Teams talk with each other, whether they are partners or rivals, and learn from each othersâ€™ designs as well as obstacles faced. Additionally, a big part of the competitions is not only teamworking, but managing to work under stressful situations in the cases when a robot fails to function before a scrimmage or competition.

As part of every competition, students must pass several interviews and inspections with FTC volunteers. These volunteers are typically industry professionals from leading technology and engineering firms. Students must explain their approach and how they went about solving the task. These meetings are wonderful opportunities for team members to build communication skills. 

Robots are majorily built of aluminum parts either made from TETRIX or MATRIX, although other parts made from either 3D printing, the use of CNC, or extruded aluminum profile from 8020. This keeps the playing field level across the country and world. In addition to the physical engineering and construction of the robot, a great deal of thought and effort go into creating the software to run the robot. Team members typically are well-versed in the building of the robot and software to run it. Other important team aspects include photography/videography, engineering notebook and documentation, community outreach, social media, graphic design, inventory management, budget, CAD, and of course building, programming, and importantly fundraising. 

The process of designing and building robots is an evolving one. The best lessons are learned by trial-and-error and hands on trouble shooting during competitions. Our team is constantly looking for ways to improve our designs by using new materials and new fabrication methods.
